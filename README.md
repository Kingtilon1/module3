The data I used was from https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bo.mccready8742/viz/FilmGenrePopularity-1910-2018/GenreRelativePopularity
This data show film genre popularity from 1910 to 2018. The script stores each line of data into an array and prints the first 10 years of film genre popularity.
